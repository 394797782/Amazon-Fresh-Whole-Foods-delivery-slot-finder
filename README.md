# wholefoods-delivery-slot-finder
An ApplesScript that refreshes the Amazon.com Whole Foods cart page every minute and notifies you once it finds an open delivery slot.

This was created because coronavirus pandemic has caused a surge in demand for grocery delivery services making it nearly impossible to find an open delivery slot and I didn't want to keep refreshing the page.

Instructions:
1. log into your Amazon account in Safari.
2. fill your Whole Foods cart and try to check out.
3. If no slots are available, run the script to be notified when a slot frees up

It will open a new window with the amazon checkout page, and minimize that window so that it can run in the background. just don't quit safari or close your computer.
If you want it to run while you are away from your computer, I recommend downloading caffeine to keep your mac awake, and then turning the volume all the way up so you can hear when it finds a slot.

It seems slots seem to open up at Midnight EST.
