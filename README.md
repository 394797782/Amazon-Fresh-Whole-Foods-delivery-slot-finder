# Whole Foods Delivery Slot Finder
An ApplesScript that refreshes the Amazon.com Whole Foods cart page every minute and notifies you once it finds an open delivery slot.

This was created because coronavirus pandemic has caused a surge in demand for grocery delivery services making it nearly impossible to find an open delivery slot and I didn't want to keep refreshing the page.

Downloading:
-
Download 'delivery-window-finder.scpt'

Instructions:
-
1. Log into your Amazon account in Safari.
2. Fill your Whole Foods cart and try to check manually. Stop once you've arrived at the page saying no slots are available
3. Open script and click the play button to run. You can now minimize the script window to hide it while it runs

Notes:
-
It will open a new window with the amazon checkout page, and minimize that window so that it can run in the background.
You'll be notified when a slot frees up. Don't quit Safari or let your computer fall asleep, or the program will stop.
If you want it to run while you are away from your computer, I recommend downloading caffeine(http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) to keep your Mac awake, then turning the volume all the way up so you can hear when it finds a slot.

It seems slots seem to open up at Midnight in each time zone so you may get lucky just reloading the checkout page manually then.
